description: This 1910 novel features Samuel Prescott, who leaves his small farming
  town to make his way in the world. But that world proves different from the small
  town he grew up in&#151;his money and friends are gone, and the new people he meets
  are immoral. Yet rather than return home, Samuel embarks on a new adventure.
